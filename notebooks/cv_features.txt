NAS (Network Attached Storage) file servers can be protected in a variety of ways. The NAS NDMP agent can be used to run NDMP file based backups as well as IntelliSnap backup with NDMP backup copies. The Windows and UNIX File System Agents can be used to run SMB or NFS file based backups as well as IntelliSnap backups with SMB/NFS backup copies. OnePass can be used for archiving. System Monitoring is available for NetApp. And file analytics are available.
System Monitoring can be used to monitor activity on NetApp file servers. Activity includes read, write, and delete operations.
The NAS NDMP Agent provides a simplified end-to-end backup and recovery solution for the data residing on a NAS file server. In addition to complete protection of file system data for disaster recovery, the NAS NDMP Agent also provides more granular backup and recovery options that operate seamlessly with your data protection. The main backup protocol is used in this agent is NDMP for backup and backup copy.
The Direct Access Recovery (DAR) feature allows the NDMP restore to seek to file offsets to restore the data rather than to read the entire backup image restoring the files as they are found. This DAR restore feature is useful when restoring up to approximately 40% of the backup image. If more than 40% of the backup is being restored, the restore is typically faster to not use DAR since streaming the read operation is faster than seeking to the individual file offsets.
The Multi-Node feature allows multi-streamed NDMP backups to use multiple MediaAgents. Load balancing can be configured so that the destination for the data streams are spread across multiple MediaAgents. Similarly, when the file server is not accessible by the destination MediaAgent, a Proxy MA list can be configured at the subclient or agent level (http://documentation.commvault.com/commvault/v11/article?p=products/nas_ndmp/t_nas_proxy_ma.htm). Multiple proxy MAs will be chosen from this list to receive data from the file server to send to the destination MAs. These features are useful when a single MediaAgent is overloaded when backing up multiple streams.
The Multi-Streaming feature enables multiple data streams per subclient for data protection operations. This feature allows backups of multiple paths in a subclient to run concurrently as part of the same job, thus reducing the total number of running jobs. Multiple content paths can be configured on a subclient by listing the paths individually or by using wildcards to identify multiple file systems to backup. For DELLEMC Isilon file servers, multiple streams can run inside a single subclient content path. The number of streams is determined by the number of data readers set on the subclient and the number of available resources in the assigned storage policy.

Ability to create and manage snapshots on various storage arrays for various applications to support backup, restore, backup copy, live browse and other various jobs
Array Configurations are parameters associated with various snap engines and hardware arrays which are used to change the default behavior for snap operations. These are available at array, storage policy copy, client and subclient levels - each overriding previous level with subclient level takes final precedence.
Array Controller is basically a MediaAgent designated as having management access to storage array to execute various snap operations. Array controllers are configured via Array Management.
Ability to mount the hardware snapshot from storage array to a MedaAgent (mount host) and copy the data from the snapshot to either tape / disk / cloud libraries
Clone is a RW copy of a snapshot used for cloning production databases for use-cases like DevTest, Data Mining, etc. A dedicated copy of the snapshot is created and the database is brought up on a designated mount proxies. These are sometimes called as Test Environments, DevTest Clones or Test Clones.
Various connection protocols like FC, iSCSI, FCoE, NFS, CIFS supported by various storage arrays. For each engine and storage array, there are various supported connection protocols and sometimes some of them are not supported. These are listed on the IntelliSnap main support page.
Ability to run the catalog phase of the backup job after the snap backup job. Previously data is cataloged as part of snap backup job and these can sometimes be resource intensive resulting in longer running snap backup jobs. By deferring the catalog phase to off-peak times, the snap backup jobs can be finished faster within backup window.
Ability to replicate the snapshots taken on a storage array to another storage array and use these secondary snapshots for various jobs like deferred catalog, live browse, backup copy, restore, etc. This helps in offloading the production storage array from IOs happening as part of the above jobs without interfering production applications.
Ability to take snapshots of the source volumes configured in Metro-Cluster High Availability configuration wherein the source volumes are present in two or more different storage arrays which are in mirror sync with each other to ensure High Availability in case of any storage failure. The snapshots are taken on all the participating storage arrays to ensure snap protection available across different datacenters for such metro volumes
Fanned-in, simultaneous  replication of  locally attached disks/volumes from multiple windows and unix machines running Oracle/Exchange/SQL/FS using block level replication(checksum or driver based) to a single destination NetApp filer. A single NetApp hardware snapshot is created after all volumes are replicated successfully. This feature is known as OSDP and LREP too.
"The CommServe database stores information about file server entities like volume, snapshot, and array name. When this information is renamed on the file server, the CommServe database will have invalid references to the previous names of these entities, which can cause snap operations to fail.<br />
<br />
The SnapManagement tool corrects the information about the file server entities stored in the CommServe database. One of the biggest advantages of using this tool instead of a QScript is that the SnapManagement Tool also performs array validation. During its operations, the tool accesses the array to discover the changes and then updates in the CommServe database with the new names.<br />
<br />
The tool does not update array entities on OnCommand Unified Manager (OCUM).<br />
<br />
Choose the SnapManagement command that you need:<br />
<br />
Renaming a volume<br />
Renaming a snapshot<br />
Renaming the array name"
Proxy clients are basically MediaAgents which are used for mounting snapshots during deferred catalog backup copy, restore jobs. These hosts which should access to the data interfaces of the storage array to be able to mount the snapshot.
Remote Snap MA is a MediaAgent which has access to storage array's management interface to execute various snap operations. Also it helps in avoiding to configure storage array libraries to interact with array and any gateway devices or command devices to send the control commands to storage array
Ability to replicate the snapshots taken on a storage array to another storage array and use these secondary snapshots for various jobs like deferred catalog, live browse, backup copy, restore, etc. This helps in offloading the production storage array from IOs happening as part of the above jobs without interfering production applications.
This feature provides offline hardware replication using NetApp's OCUM server
Revert is a restore operation to move the source volumes to the previously taken point-in-time snapshots. This provides the ability to quickly restore the source volumes to a selected snap ensuring as little downtime for applications as possible.
Ability to browse the data from a snapshot by mounting it on a mount host and even though catalog of the backed up data is not done as the catalog phase is deferred
IntelliSnap engines are dynamically loadable plugins used to interact with storage arrays to execute various snap operations.
Ability to restore data from a snapshot either to the source volumes used by the applications to recover from corruption or go back to an older time-in-point or as out-of-place restore on the same source client or different client. There are two restore options available - one by mounting the snapshot and moving the data blocks or by doing hardware restore on the storage array
Out of place restore support from snap backup and backup copy jobs.
Ability to mount the snapshot of NFS / CIFS snap backups to multiple hosts for backup copy jobs
Ability to mount the hardware snapshot on a Windows or Linux VSA Proxy MediaAgent and completely by-passing the mount on ESXi server and then run backup copy, restore and other jobs.

The Storage Provisioning feature provides allocation of storage on various disk arrays from a single Commvault interface. This storage can be used for magnetic library space, disks for virtual machines, disks for application testing, etc. Each user can manage their own storage. Expiration dates can be set so the space is automatically reclaimed.
The Storage Provisioning feature uses Provisioning Policies to define different ways to provision storage. The Provisioning Policy identifies a quota, expiration date, a set of disk arrays to provision from, and the users who have access to that policy. These policies can be used to control access to different types of arrays and/or different storage speeds.
